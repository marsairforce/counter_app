# A simple counter application
This is a device that has 2 7-segment displays, and buttons.


It can be used for simple manual counting of something.
I originally built it for a "It has been xx days since.." signs.

This project was a test of the waters to see what OSHPark is able to create.

It started off as a breadboard experiment, then a hand wire job on a punchboard, and then a finished PCB board.

It was an exercise to learn how to use Kicad as well. Before I had been trying to use gEDA and suite to make a circuit board layout, but never got past the schematic phase. Perhaps because there is no existing parts or footprint library for gEDA and also no documentation for how to use the tools (that are not even GUI based) to try to create a symbol and a footprint.  I was able to get farther with Kicad in an evening than I was able to get over several years of coming back to poking at gEDA.

It was also the first product built using Attiny-85 device. Learning how to use shift registers, multiplex switch button inputs, software interrupts.

All the components were things I had in stock, thru-hole parts.
